## Repository description
It is a simple repository to store the competitive problems I have solved... Nothing special nor interesting. However, it is worth mentioning that this is not my typical programming style but one rather sloppy, to minimize the time needed to solve each problem.

### Attention
There may be problems that were falsely inserted here and have not yet been completed . I am sorry for any disturbance this might cause.

Your _feedback_ is welcome.
